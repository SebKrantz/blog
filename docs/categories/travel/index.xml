      <description>&lt;p&gt;In mid-July 2025, I decided to embark on a 6-week trip from Zanzibar/Dar es Salaam to Cape Town via public transport. My reasons for taking this trip were burnout – I had finished my PhD in 2024 without any real vacation that year and had gone straight into short-term consulting and job searching – and my frustration with the inhumane job market this year, particularly in the US and international institutions. I had also been conceiving this trip for a while, and felt like it was the right time to just do it.
