In mid July 2025, I decided to embark on a 6 week trip from Zanzibar/Dar Es Salaam to Cape Town via public transport. My reasons for taking this trip were burnout – I had finished my PhD in 2024 without any real vacation that year and had gone straight into short-term consulting and Job searching – and my frustration with the inhumane Job Market this year, particularly in the US and international institutions. I had also been conceiving this trip for a while, and felt like it was the right time to just do it. My original inspiration had been the [Rovos Rail](https://rovos.com/) itinerary shown below. 

<p align="center">
    <a href="../from-zanzibar-to-cape-town/IMG_E1505.JPG"><img src="../from-zanzibar-to-cape-town/IMG_E1505.JPG" alt="Rovos Rail Itinerary" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;"></a>
    Rovos Rail Dar Es Salaam to Cape Town Itinerary - My Inspiration
</p>

Specifically, Lernidee produced a [beautiful 42-minute commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-iJEDPqwO8) about this trip which I had encountered on YouTube a while ago. I was immediately fascinated by the fact that there was a private train going all this way through five countries in Southern Africa. The tracks, it turns out, are due to Cecil Rhodes and his ambition to build a railway from Cape Town to Cairo, and to the Tanzania–Zambia Railway (TAZARA), built from 1970 to 1975 by the governments of Tanzania, Zambia, and China (under Mao) to eliminate landlocked Zambia's economic dependence on Rhodesia and (apartheid) South Africa by facilitating the export of Zambian copper through the port in Dar Es Salaam. 

It is an itinerary rich in history and natural beauty, and also very easy to travel as a German citizen – I just needed a visa for Tanzania, all other countries are visa free except for Zimbabwe where a Visa can be picked up at the Border for $30. Of course, I would have loved to take the Rovos Train, but at $15,000 for a 16-day adventure it is quite expensive. I also wanted to take more time, and didn't really like the idea of traveling through Africa in colonial luxury. I resolved that if the tracks are there, it must also be possible to take other trains or, if necessary, busses. 

So I searched for flights, and found that flying directly to Zanzibar with Condor was my cheapest option. I had been on the Island before over newyear 2012/13 – being based in Rwanda as a volunteer – but I thought maybe a lot has changed since then, and I knew it is a great place to relax for a few days before starting the big trip. I also had some local connections in the Statistical Office through an [ODI Fellow](https://odi.org/en/fellowship-scheme/), as well as to the newly founded [Africa Urban Lab](https://www.aul.city/) – An emerging research Lab linked with the [African School of Economics](https://africanschoolofeconomics.com/) which also aims to establish a [Zanzibar campus](https://www.asezanzibar.com/). So I flew there on the 21st of July 2025 and booked a [hotel](https://tarawandahousebystawi.zanzibar-hotels.net/de/) in Stone Town for four days. 

## Zanzibar and Dar Es Salaam – Slave Trade, Beaches, Islands, Forests

Once the center of the East African slave and spice trades, Zanzibar was ruled by Arab sultans and later became a British protectorate. Its rich cultural heritage reflects centuries of African, Arab, Persian, and European influences. Stone Town is the historic heart of Zanzibar City – a labyrinth of narrow alleys, bustling bazaars, and intricately carved wooden doors. Its UNESCO World Heritage status highlights its unique blend of architectural styles and vibrant street life. A particular highlight to me is the fresh sugarcane juice, which is not easily found elsewhere in Africa. Below you can see me consuming it first alone, and then with Ahmad, a local statistician, and his wife.

The historic Old Fort was originally built by the Portuguese in the 17th century and later re-built by the Omanis in the 18th century. It was used as a garrison and prison in the 19th century, and as a terminal of the Zanzibar railways 1905-28. I was also told incoming slaves were gathered on the floor there before being brought to the market.

In the evenings, Stone Town Beach comes alive with locals and visitors alike. One can enjoy the tranquil scenery, see traditional dhow boats with triangular sail gliding into the sunset, but also watch some talented footbal players and the Zanzibar Flippers – a group of local acrobats demonstrating spectacular moves using old tires as trampolines.

A well known excursion from Stone Town is visiting Changuu (Prison Island) by boat – 5.6 km (3.5 mi) northwest of Stone Town. The island was uninhabited until the 1860s when the first Sultan of Zanzibar, Majid bin Said, gave it to two Arabs who used it as a prison for rebellious slaves prior to shipping them abroad or selling them at the slave market in Stone Town. More recently, the island has become a government-owned tourist resort and houses a collection of endangered Aldabra giant tortoises – a gift from the British governor of the Seychelles in 1919.

Another well-known adventure is Safari Blue – a full-day boat and snorkeling trip exploring the crystal-clear waters, sandbanks, and small islands southwest of Stone Town. The excursion includes opportunities for dolphin spotting, swimming, and enjoying a seafood barbecue on a remote island. Taking the budget option, I ended up in a crammed boat with lots of Africans – and befriended a Tanzanian family which took me out for some drinks in Stone Town afterwards. I also met some old friends from Prison Island on a sandbank – the world is small over here.

Approximately in the middle of the island is Jozani Forest, the largest remaining indigenous forest on Zanzibar. It is a biodiversity hotspot and home to the rare and endemic Zanzibar Red Colobus Monkeys. Right next to it is an extended mangrove forest – with at least three different types of mangroves. <!-- Guided walks through Jozani offer a chance to observe these playful primates and learn about the island’s unique flora and fauna. -->

Traveling further to the east coast, the island’s many beaches are also renowned for their powdery white sand and turquoise waters, offering a tranquil escape from the city. The coastline is dotted with palm trees, villages, and resorts. Paje is a lively beach village famous for its kite surfing scene and relaxed atmosphere, while nearby Michamvi offers a quieter, more secluded vibe. The Rock Restaurant is a popular spot for fresh seafood and local dishes, and Kae Funk Sunset Beach is known for its stunning sunsets, live music, and laid-back beach bar ambiance.

From Zanzibar to Dar Es Salaam it takes about 1.5 hours with the fast ferries, which are the cheapest way to travel, but dashing through big ocean waves at high speeds may induce sea-sickness. Approaching Dar, one passes by the Kivukoni Fish Market where local fishermen bring in fresh catches and residents come to buy, cook, and sell.

A bit further on the right side, one passes by the Azania Front Lutheran Church. It was built by the German missionaries in 1898, in the Bavarian style of the time, with a red-tiled roof, tiled canopies over the windows and bright white walls. I stayed in a hostel right next to it (Luther House Hostel) and had the pleasure to meet the accountant of the Church who took me on an exclusive tour including the church tower – from which I enjoyed scenic views of both the city and the port. The port overall seemed very busy, with many ships waiting to enter the harbour.

Other things to do in Dar is to visit the National Museum and the Botanical Garden, both close to the church, but there is not a lot to see and also not much historical storyline. The only two exhibits I photographed were the countries first airplane and a car driven by Nyerere. Next to the museum is a memorial of the [1988 US Embassy bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_United_States_embassy_bombings), where al-Qaeda suicide bombers simultaneously detonated trucks loaded with TNT before the US Embassies in Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi, killing 213 in Nairobi and 11 in Dar. There are also several beaches, but none competitive with Zanzibar in the immediate vicinity of the city. Yet, [Bravo Coco Beach](https://bravococo.co.tz/home) is a nice place to hang out, and I was fortunate to meet Nasra, a Somali women who had lived in Europe for almost two decades but had recently returned to Dar to start a luxury hair care chain. Her Tanzanian coworkers joined later, and we had excellent conversations about Africa and the future – its encouraging to see that, amidst rising global uncertainty, some people are returning to build this continent. I was also very fortunate to meet my aunt and her husband in Dar, who were at the end of an extended vacation and had just taken the [TAZARA train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAZARA_Railway) from Mbeya. Together we visited Kariakoo Market – the largest market in Dar. This indoor/outdoor market spills into several city blocks, and buzzes day and night.

## Dar to Mbeya with the TAZARA – A Scenic Adventure at Leasurely Pace 

Having spent a relaxing yet eventful 8 days in Zanzibar and Dar Es Salaam, I was finally ready, on the 29th of July, to embark on my big journey towards Cape Town. The first stage was a scenic overnight train jouney with the [TAZARA train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAZARA_Railway) to Mbeya, the largest city in southern Tanzania situated only ~100km from the border to Zambia. As mentioned in the introduction, this train was built from 1970 to 1975 by the governments of Tanzania, Zambia, and China (under Mao) to eliminate landlocked Zambia's economic dependence on Rhodesia and (apartheid) South Africa by facilitating the export of Zambian copper through the port in Dar Es Salaam. The regular travel time for the ~850km journey was 24 hours – but we ended up taking 32. I reserved a first-class coach, which I shared with Alex, an american from California. It is a lying coach with some blankets provided and a table – dating, it seems, from 1975 and has seen a lot of train journeys. Thus, not much is left from the original comfort and cleanliness, but it is still very acceptable. The main source of discomfort with the train are the tracks, which are uneven/bumpy in some places, and also have gaps between adjacent segments to accommodate the extreme heat in summer which lets the steel expand. These gaps, traversed at a speed of only 30-50km/h make for a constant "du dum, du dum" sound throughout most of the trip. The food served 3 times a day is edible but not great either. Yet, I believe the breathtaking scenery makes it totally worthwhile to choose this mode of transport. You can judge it yourself, let the journey begin.

    From Dar Es Salaam to Mbeya with the TAZARA Train
</p>

In Mbeya five of us from the first-class coach, that is Alex from Palo Alto California, Ana from Cape Town, and a frensh lady with her daughter, and me, ended up in the [Peace of Mind Hotel](https://peaceofmindhotel.com/). Seems like the place to be in Mbeya – my Aunt in Dar hat told me about it and connected me with Henry, a local guide based at the hotel. Given the happy coincidence of out extended company, hired Henry and a car and went on a Hike to [Lake Ngozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ngozi), the second largest crater lake in Africa, with a surface area of 3.1km2. The lake is located at an altitude of 2622m, most of which can be ascended by car, but the last ~300m need to be hiked on a path of 1.7km length through a kind of highland jungle.

The next day, Alex and Ana continued towards Malawi, and I took a private tour with Henry to a view point of the [Great Rift Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) close to the city, which itself lies within the valley. The day was a bit hazy so our sight was not perfect, but the pictures and footage still give an impression of the extent of it.

## Mbeya to Lusaka – History of Zambia and Commercial Fare

Right after the Rift Valley trip, I departed for the Zambia Border at Tunduma with a small bus. There had been an unexpected 30k fee at the Rift Valley view point which lowered my cash to 8k Tanzanian Shilling or $3.2 USD. I didn't want to get Tanzanian cash again before going to Zambia, but was told it would suffice to get me to Zambia. And surprisingly it did – I spent 3k on a boda (motorcycle taxi) to the Mbeya bus station, 4k to go with the small bus to the central bus station at Tunduma about 100km away, and then 1k to go from there to the Zambia border with a Matatu taxi. In comparison, the trip to the view point with Henry by private car had cost me 100k ($40), so this was a solemn reminder that in Africa, many things are possible on almost any budget. In Tunduma I crossed the border and wanted to check into a Hotel I had been told is on the Zambian side, but I soon realized that it was in fact in Tanzania. However, I was fortunate to meet Lole, a Zambian working at the border/bus station on Nakonde – the name of the town on the Zambian side. He was very friendly and showed me to a local Hotel which was not even on Google Maps. In general, there is not much in Nakonde, so I was greateful for this encounter. Later that evening I invited him for beer and he told me some things about the town and the one stop border post. According to him, it takes only 2 hours for a typical truck to pass the border, which would be very good in African comparison where the median is one week according to 2020 Doing Business Survey data. This highlights the need for more up to date information on some of these borders – ideally via digital information systems as suggested by [this SSATP working paper](https://www.ssatp.org/sites/default/files/publication/TRANSPORT%20CORRIDORS_web_single.pdf).

From Nakonde I then took a big South African tourbus to Lusaka – a 1000km 16h journey. Originally, I had of course hoped to continue with the TAZARA train directly from Mbeya, but it turns out, due to maintenance issues, the train is currently only operating between Dar and Mbeya. So I had to take the tour Bus, which, beholding that it took me 32 hours to drive 850km from Dar to Mbeya, was a welcome rotation. What was less welcoming was my experience trying to get on the Bus. I had agreed with Lole to meet at the Bus station in Nakonde in the morning after spending the night in the Hotel and he would guide me to the right bus. But, when I texted him in the morning there was no response – due to network issues as we later found out – and I set off for the station on my own. As I walked into the station compoind, it turned out there were 3 or 4 busses of different companies and sizes going to Lusaka, and I immediately had 4 conductors taking my arm to guide me to their bus. That obviously didn't work out, and they started shouting at me and at each other and to pull me uncomfortably hard, others joined around them, so I became a spectacle in the bus station – a white man being dragged around by competing conductors while trying to hold on to his luggage. In the end I also got a bit scared and started shouting at them as well. Using all my strength I was able to free myself and set off back to the Hotel again. On the way back there I bumped into Lole who had wanted to pick me. We returned to the station, avoiding the crowd, and he arranged for me a ticket with the South African company. <br>

I had, at this point, been to 14 countries in Africa already, but I have not yet had such a bus station experience. When I returned to Germany in September and told my Aunt about it – who had also been to Zambia – she told me about a very similar experience on the bus station in Lusaka. So beware of Zambian bus stations. Overall, I was grateful to have met Lole in Nakonde – without him it would have been difficult to find accommodation and get on the bus. <br>

I spent 3 days in Lusaka, visiting the excellent National Museum and learning about early independet Zambia in the 60's and 70's under president [Kenneth Kaunda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Kaunda) – a pan-african socialist independence leader and a founding father of the Organization of Africa Unity which would later become the African Union. Notably, he who also maintained good ties with the West and temporarily hosted and supported a bunch of other independence leaders from the region – such as Sam Nujoma from Namibia and Robert Mugabe from, at the time, Southern Rhodesia. <br>

I also visited a local market with two french travelers whom I met at [Natwange Backpackers](https://www.natwangebackpackers.com), one of whom was a veterinarian and the other on a business trip from Nairobi. They wanted to taste some caterpillars – a local speciality – but I searched for and was able to acquire a pair of excellent hand-made leather shoes for ~$50. I had, in fact, not bought any good leather shoes since 2021, where I had stocked several pairs of second-hand shoes from Ugandan Markets which I was still wearing down. But it was about time to get a fresh pair for special occasions, and so I was happy about this find – enabling me to both support local manufacturing and continue my tradition of African shoes. <br>

Also during my presence in Lusaka, the [Agricultural and Commercial Show](https://www.acsz.co.zm) took place. Organized annually by the Agricultural & Commercial Cooperative Society of Zambia (ACSZ), it is Zambia's flagship exhibition, held each year at the Lusaka Showgrounds since its establishment in 1919. Spanning several days, the event draws tens of thousands of attendees, along with hundreds of local and international exhibitors, turning Lusaka into a vibrant hub for agricultural innovation, trade, and networking. Its purpose is to showcase advancements in agriculture, commerce, and industry, foster business partnerships, boost investment, and celebrate Zambian culture, making it a cornerstone of national economic and social development. I was fortunate to accompany Rolf Richard from Norway to the show who also stayed at Natwange Lodge – a senior agricultural expert with engagements in Zambia for almost 20 years. In the end, however, it were the music and zulu dances, but also the TAZARA stand, that caught my attention.

From Lusaka I wanted to to continue again by train to Livingstone, and there is a [passenger service](https://zrl.com.zm/passengers/) along this route by Zambia Railways, but the Train only departs once a week on Saturday morning, and I had arrived in Lusaka on Saturday and wanted to leave on Tuesday. Thus, I was compelled to again take a bus, which at ~8 hours was also faster than the purported 18 hours with the train. To avoid any further hassle at the bus station in Lusaka, I ordered the taxi driver that had taken me and the french guys around town earlier to pick up a ticket for me at the bus station and then come to pick me and drop me off directly at the bus. That worked very well, and I arrived safely in Livingstone on Tuesday the 5th of August in the evening. Packpackers lodges were unfortunately already full, thus my local driver that I met at the bus station dropped me off at Chapa Classic Lodge, which offered great comfort at affordable rates a 10-minute walk from the center of town. <br>

## Livingstone and Victoria Falls – In the Footsteps of the Great Explorer

The first thing I did in Livingstone was, of course, to visit the Livingstone Museum on honor of the great explorer and namegiver of the town. David Livingstone was a Scottish missionary, explorer, and physician whose expeditions through Africa in the 19th century left a lasting legacy. Driven by a blend of evangelical zeal and a desire to map uncharted regions, Livingstone ventured deep into the African interior at a time when much of the continent remained unknown to Europeans. His travels were not only groundbreaking in terms of exploration but also influential in raising awareness about the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, which he condemned in his writings and public lectures. <br>

One of Livingstone’s most iconic moments came in 1855 when he became the first European to witness the majestic Mosi-oa-Tunya waterfall on the Zambezi River. Struck by its grandeur, he renamed it "Victoria Falls" in honor of Queen Victoria. Today, this UNESCO World Heritage site stands as one of the most awe-inspiring natural wonders in the world. Just across the Zambian side of the falls lies the town of Livingstone, named in his honor. Once the capital of Northern Rhodesia, it now serves as a vibrant hub for tourists exploring the falls and the surrounding region. <br>

<!-- A visit to the Livingstone Museum, the oldest and largest museum in Zambia, offers a deep dive into both local history and Livingstone’s legacy. The museum houses a significant collection of his personal belongings, letters, and maps, painting a vivid picture of his journeys and interactions with local communities. For travelers seeking to understand the cultural and historical context of this extraordinary part of Africa, the museum—and the town itself—offer a compelling connection to one of the most legendary figures in African exploration. -->

From the museum I went for an initial exploration of the falls and the Zambezi River, by visiting the Victoria Falls Bridge connecting Zambia and Zimbabwe next to the falls. This masterpiece of British engineering was completed in 1905 and was originally part of Cecil Rhodes' ambitious plan to build a Cape-to-Cairo railway. Suspended 128 meters above the gorge, the bridge offers spectacular views of the falls and the Batoka Gorge below, and today it serves not only as a vital transport link but also as a popular spot for thrill-seekers—home to one of the world’s most famous bungee jumps. Since the bridge denotes an international border, with customs and a fair number of trucks queueing, I also had some interesting conversations with my local guide about the ease/means of transit. In the afternoon, I embarked on a scenic sunset cruise on the upper part of the river above the falls.

The next day then I booked a full-day tour to see the Victoria Falls from both sides. They are unfortunately also split between the two countries, with Zimbabwe posessing about 2/3 of the falls and Zambia the remaining 1/3. Thus, logistics are a bit complicated. A [guided tour](https://www.getyourguide.com/en-gb/victoria-falls-town-l127068/victoria-falls-guided-tour-of-the-falls-from-both-sides-t414370/?visitor-id=H0AHDLWQLLCNPK7OTTFV48YYHJ6FLEWF&locale_autoredirect_optout=true) with [Cuckoo Safaris](https://www.cuckoosafaris.com/) is bookable with pickup in both Livingstone and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. The tour starts in Zimbabwe, so coming from Livingstone I had to get a visa for $30 and cross the border, pay $50 for the park entrance there, and see the Zimbabwean falls in a guided 3 hour tour with a Zimbabwan guide. Afterwards, cross the border again (invalidating the visa), pay another $30 park fee, and take a 2 hour tour with a Zambian guide. One can, of course, just see the falls from one side with less hassle, or book a helicopter trip from either side to fly over them, but to me, seeing them close up in full width was rewarding enough. As part of our tour group, I met Ruby, a teacher from London whom I enjoyed conversing with – thus the joint picture.  <br> 

Referring to the falls, some locals speak of “The Smoke That Thunders” – a fitting analogy for this truly captivating and humbling site, where on average 1,100 m³ of water per second plunge 107 meters into a deep gorge stretching over a width of 1,737 meters. From a distance, the immense spray rises so high it resembles smoke from a massive wildfire. Geologically, the falls are the result of millions of years of erosion through basalt rock, creating a dramatic series of zig-zagging gorges carved by the Zambezi River — a dynamic landscape that continues to evolve. This ongoing geological activity, combined with the falls' sheer scale and natural beauty, is part of the reason why they are recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The following day I also explored the george below the falls by means of a wildwater rafting expedition with [Maano Adventures](https://www.maanoadventures.com/), which tooks us 14km down thr river through ~20 rapids. Apart from the thrill of the rapids, the scenery of the george is fantastic and reminded me of a trip on the colorado river in Canyonlands National Park some years ago. The company was in the process of filming a new commercial and offered us free access to the footage for a review. In comparison with the White Nile at Jinja – my only previous rafting experience – I found the Sambesi rapids a bit smaller and more manageable (the raft didn't tip over), but also the water level of the Sambesi was not at its peak.

## Kasane and Chobe National Park – African Wildlife at its Best

From Livingstone I went by taxi to Kasane, Botsuana – only 75km away. There I spent the night at [Elephant Trails](https://etbackpackers.com/), a guesthouse and backpackers specialized on Sarafis in the adjacent [Chobe National Park](https://www.chobe.com/) – with own safari cars, guides, and competitive packages for backpacker budgets. I was able to book a Safari combo package for the next day consisting of a 5-hour game drive (early morning to noon), lunch, and an afternoon boat ride on the Chobe River. <br>

Located in northern Botswana, Chobe National Park is renowned for its large elephant population—one of the highest concentrations in Africa. The park spans diverse ecosystems, including lush floodplains and dense woodlands, supporting a rich variety of wildlife such as lions, hippos, giraffes, and over 450 bird species. The Chobe river forms the northern boundary of the park and serves as a vital water source for wildlife, especially during the dry season. Boat safaris offer close-up views of elephants, crocodiles, and hippos along its banks. <br>

Overall, the package was a fantastic deal, offering a premier wildlife experience at a very affordable rate. Personal highlights for me, apart from the sizeable Elephant herdes and cose up view of crocodiles sunbathing on the river banks, were a lion family with cubs, and, most notably, a live chase experience of a lioness silently approaching an antilope – with us in the middle of it. She even used safari cars as cover to get closer to the Antilope – as you can see in the footage.

In the end, the lioness was unfortunately (fortunately for the antelope) not successful. Part of the reason was, as our guide excellently explained to us, that the antilope was alerted by the cars watching her, thinking "why am I so special today, there must be a predator around". Thus, while the experience was amazing, it also showcases how tourism makes it harder, especially for the sought after predators, to survive naturally in these parks. <br>

From Kasane then I took a night bus to Gaborone on the same day at 8pm (after the safari). It traversed the ~930km down south via Francistown in around 12 hours and thus arrived in the morning. Unfortunately, it had a flat tire around 30km from Gaborone, so most of us switched to a smaller bus to make it to the city faster. 

## Gaborone – History of Botswana

Gaborone is the capital and largest city of Botswana, located in the southeastern part of the country near the border with South Africa. It became the capital in 1965, just before Botswana gained independence from British colonial rule in 1966. Botswana was formerly known as the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, and upon independence, it transitioned peacefully into a democratic republic. The country has since been noted for its political stability, strong economic growth driven by diamond mining, and commitment to conservation and wildlife protection. Gaborone has grown rapidly and now serves as the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Botswana.

That being said, it is still the smallest and most peaceful capital city of any African country I have visited to far (including Namibia/Windhoek). Below are some impressions of a typical business day in Gaborone.

#### The Three Dikgosi (Chiefs) and the Road to Independence

Long before colonial involvement, the land was inhabited by various Tswana-speaking groups and the San people. These communities developed complex societies with chieftaincy systems, trade networks, and internal diplomacy.

A pivotal moment in Botswana’s pre-independence history occurred in the late 19th century, when three influential chiefs — Khama III of the Bangwato, Sebele I of the Bakwena, and Bathoen I of the Bangwaketse — played a crucial role in safeguarding their territory from colonial exploitation. In 1895, these chiefs undertook a bold journey to Britain to petition Queen Victoria against the incorporation of Bechuanaland into the British South Africa Company, which was controlled by imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Their mission was successful: Bechuanaland remained a British Protectorate under direct Crown rule, rather than becoming a settler colony. This helped preserve the autonomy of the local leadership and prevented the widespread dispossession of land experienced in Rhodesia and South Africa.

This extraordinary diplomatic act by the three chiefs is commemorated in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, at the *Three Dikgosi Monument*. Unveiled in 2005, the monument features towering bronze statues of Khama III, Sebele I, and Bathoen I, and stands as a symbol of unity, national pride, and visionary leadership.

<!-- The site has become a major cultural and tourist landmark, reminding citizens and visitors alike of the enduring legacy of Botswana’s traditional leaders in shaping a modern, independent nation. The story of the three chiefs not only underscores the importance of indigenous agency in colonial history but also highlights the values of peace, dialogue, and strategic thinking that continue to define Botswana's political culture today. -->

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the British administered the Protectorate indirectly through the traditional chiefs (dikgosi), allowing local governance through customary law. This indirect rule preserved many Tswana political structures but also meant minimal economic investment in infrastructure, education, or industry.

After the formation of the **Union of South Africa in 1910**, there was consistent pressure from the South African government for Britain to transfer the Bechuanaland Protectorate, along with Basutoland (Lesotho) and Swaziland (Eswatini), into the Union. The chiefs and the people of Bechuanaland opposed this, fearing the racial segregation policies and land dispossession that would come under South African rule, especially as apartheid became entrenched in the 1940s and 1950s. Their resistance, combined with Britain's hesitation, prevented the transfer.

During this time, political consciousness began to grow within Bechuanaland. Although largely rural and underdeveloped, a small educated elite began to emerge, many of whom were inspired by nationalist movements across Africa. This led to the formation of political organizations that would later push for full self-rule.

A pivotal moment came with the controversial figure of **Seretse Khama**, the grandson of Chief Khama III. In the late 1940s, Seretse studied law in the UK and married a white Englishwoman, **Ruth Williams**, which sparked outrage both in South Africa and among some traditionalists in Bechuanaland. Under South African pressure, the British exiled Seretse in 1951. This move sparked widespread protest in the Protectorate and led to greater political mobilization.

Eventually allowed to return in 1956, Seretse renounced his claim to the chieftaincy and turned to politics. In 1962, he founded the **Bechuanaland Democratic Party (BDP)**, which advocated for independence, development, and national unity. The BDP won the country’s first general elections in 1965 under a new constitution that laid the groundwork for self-government.

On **30 September 1966**, Bechuanaland became the **Republic of Botswana**, with Seretse Khama as its first president. The transition was peaceful, and Botswana immediately embarked on a course of democratic governance, economic planning, and cautious diplomacy. Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world at independence — with just a few kilometers of paved roads and little in the way of formal infrastructure — Botswana’s stable leadership and effective institutions helped it rapidly develop into one of Africa’s most successful democracies.

The **National Museum and Art Gallery** in Gaborone showcases Botswana's rich history, art, and heritage. It offers visitors an insight into the country’s cultural diversity, traditional crafts, archaeological finds, and the history of its struggle for independence. The museum also has an impressive collection of local art, reflecting the creative talents of Botswana’s artists, and often hosts temporary exhibitions, educational programs, and cultural events. <!-- It serves as both a place of learning and a reminder of Botswana's journey, making it an essential stop for anyone interested in understanding the nation’s history and identity. -->

I would have liked to spend more Time in Botswana, e.g., to visit the **Okavango Delta** – the world's largest inland delta, a UNESCO World Heritage site, renowned for its rich biodiversity and vibrant wildlife, including elephants, lions, and various bird species, but a job interview I wanted to take from Johannesburg and my overall schedule precluded further activities there. Transit to Johannesburg with the early morning Intercape Bus was very smooth – it takes around 7-8 hours for the ~400km trip with border crossing and stop in Pretoria, thus I arrived in the afternoon. 


## Johannesburg – Ghandi, Mandela, Soweto and Apartheid

## Kimberley – Diamond Rush and Cecil Rhodes

## Western Cape – Sublime Landscapes, Wine Farms, Excursions and Hikes

## The End
